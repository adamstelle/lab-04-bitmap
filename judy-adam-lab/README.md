<h1>The Best Darn Bitmap Manipulator Around</h1>
<em>A node app for reading, manipulating and saving new bitmap images.</em>

<h3>Instructions: fork/clone this repo and run "npm install" in your project directory.</h3>

This project includes 3 color palette manipulations: greyscale, inverting, and scaling one of RGB. It also includes a module to automatically create a border (3px wide) around the image.

It allows for command line inputs for Bitmap images to parse. Syntax is the following: "node index.js <img>." Current options are:
<em>bitmappic</em>
<em>fingerprint</em>
<em>house</em>
<em>nonpalette</em>

There's a LOT more we could do with this app. Hope you enjoy playing with it as much as we enjoyed writing it.

Much love,
Adam & Judy
